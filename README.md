## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. Define Your Vibe
Pick a genre from our extensive library. From the neon-soaked streets of **Cyberpunk** to the calm waves of **Ambient Piano**, the choice is yours.

### 2. Customize the DNA
Want it faster? Darker? More acoustic? Use the custom tuning panel to tweak the AI's parameters. You can even upload a reference melody to guide the generation.



### 3. Add the Soul (Lyrics & Vocals)
Type in your story. PulseWave AI analyzes the sentiment of your lyrics to match the musical composition perfectly. Choose between different vocal styles—from ethereal sopranos to gritty rock baritones.

## 🎧 Features Deep Dive

### 🎹 Customization Suite
Unlike other generators, PulseWave gives you granular control:
* **Prompt-to-Music:** Describe your scene (e.g., "A rainy night in Tokyo, 80s synth vibes") and watch it work.
* **Stem Export:** (Pro Tip) Export separate tracks for drums, bass, and melody for further mixing in your favorite DAW.

### ❤️ Social & Sharing
Music is better when shared. PulseWave features a built-in community feed:
* **Global Pulse:** See what's trending globally.
* **Personal Library:** Save your "Likes" and curate your own AI-generated playlists.
* **Instant Export:** Download in high-quality `.wav` or `.mp3` formats.

### Tips for your GitHub Repo:
* **Visuals:** Replace the `[Image of...]` placeholder with a real screenshot of your app or a cool GIF of a music visualizer. It makes the README look 10x more professional.
* **Badges:** I added a few badges at the top. You can customize them at [Shields.io](https://shields.io/).
* **Demo:** If you have a live link, add a big "Live Demo" button right at the top.
