## 🚩 Overview

**PulseWave AI** is a multi-agent framework designed to create high-fidelity music across any genre. Inspired by the modularity of elizaOS, PulseWave allows developers to deploy "Music Agents" that can compose, write lyrics, and produce full-length tracks autonomously.

Whether you are building a standalone music utility or integrating AI soundscapes into a larger ecosystem, PulseWave provides the tools to generate, play, and share music without limits.

## 🏗 Architecture

PulseWave is built with a modular "Plugin-Adapter" architecture, ensuring that the core synthesis engine remains lightweight while features can be expanded indefinitely.

### Core Components

* **@pulsewave/core**: The central orchestration engine for audio buffers and neural processing.
* **@pulsewave/plugin-lyrics**: NLP-driven lyric generation and phonetic alignment.
* **@pulsewave/plugin-soundscapes**: Advanced Foley and environmental sound synthesis.
* **@pulsewave/adapter-web**: A sleek, reactive interface for free play and social interaction.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Capability | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🎭 **Vibe Agents** | Custom Personalities | Define specific "Vibes" (e.g., Lo-Fi, Phonk) via JSON config. |
| 🎼 **Multi-Modal Gen** | Text-to-Music | Generate music from prompts, lyrics, or even visual moods. |
| 🎤 **Vocal Synthesis** | Lyric-to-Voice | Transform text into emotive vocals or choral harmonies. |
| 🎹 **Stem Control** | Instrumental Toggle | Isolate vocals, drums, or melodies with a single command. |
| 🌐 **Social Graph** | Like & Share | Integrated protocol for sharing "Pulses" to decentralized feeds. |
| 🔊 **Infinite Play** | Zero-Cost Streaming | Stream AI-generated tracks locally or via cloud providers for free. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (for audio encoding)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pulsewave-ai.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd pulsewave-ai

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the framework
pnpm run build

```

### Running an Agent

To start your first music generation agent using a pre-defined "Vibe":

```bash
pnpm run start --character=characters/synthwave-dreams.json

```

## 🎭 Character/Vibe Definition

PulseWave uses a JSON-based configuration system to define the "DNA" of the music. Below is an example of a **Vibe File**:

```json
{
  "name": "Neon Horizon",
  "genre": "Synthwave",
  "bio": [
    "A digital entity obsessed with 1980s retro-futurism.",
    "Specializes in melancholic pads and high-energy arpeggios."
  ],
  "settings": {
    "tempo": "110-125 BPM",
    "key": "A Minor",
    "instruments": ["Juno-60", "LinnDrum", "DX7 Electric Piano"],
    "voice": "Ethereal Male"
  },
  "plugins": ["@pulsewave/plugin-lyrics", "@pulsewave/plugin-reverb"]
}

```

## 🔧 Technical Capabilities

* **Stochastic Composition**: Uses probabilistic models to ensure no two tracks are ever identical.
* **Dynamic Lyric Mapping**: Real-time alignment of AI lyrics to the generated beat's transient peaks.
* **Cross-Platform Adapters**: Deploy your music utility as a Web App, Discord Bot, or Telegram Mini-App seamlessly.
* **High-Fidelity Export**: Supports `.wav`, `.flac`, and `.mp3` exports with metadata injection.
